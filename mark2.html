      <p><b>Bleach</b><br> (stylized as BLEACH) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Tite Kubo. 
      It follows the adventures of the hotheaded teenager Ichigo Kurosaki, who inherits his parents' destiny after 
      he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper—a death personification similar to the Grim Reaper—from another Soul Reaper, 
      Rukia Kuchiki. 
      </p>
      <p>
      His new-found powers force him to take on the duties of defending humans from evil spirits and guiding
       departed souls to the afterlife, and set him on journeys to various ghostly realms of existence.
      Bleach was serialized in Shueisha's shōnen (teenage males) manga magazine Weekly Shōnen Jump from August 
      2001 to August 2016, with its chapters collected in seventy-four tankōbon volumes. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The series has spawned a media franchise that includes an anime television series adaptation that was 
      produced by Tokyo-based studio Pierrot from 2004 to 2012, two original video animation (OVA) episodes, 
      four animated feature films, ten stage musicals, and numerous video games, as well as many types of
       Bleach-related merchandise. A Japanese live-action film adaptation produced by Warner Bros. was released in 2018.
      In North America, the manga was licensed for English release by Viz Media in 2004. They have released its 
      seventy-four volumes and published its chapters in their Shonen Jump magazine from November 2007 
      until the magazine's final issue in April 2012.

      Bleach received the 50th Shogakukan Manga Award for the shōnen category in 2005. Despite
       significant downturns in both the Japanese and English manga markets, 
      Bleach continued to perform well commercially, and had over 120 million tankōbon volumes in circulation worldwide as of 2018, making it the eleventh best-selling manga in history.
